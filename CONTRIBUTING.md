Its very easy to become a **Designer**. All you need to do is

###### STEPS:
1. Familiarize yourself with our [Design Guidlines](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/design)
2. Create a pull request for an [Icon Request](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ICON+Request&template=---icon-request.md&title=%5BICON+REQUEST%5D+). Ensure you  correctly fill out the pull request template.
3. A **Reviewer** will verify your payment link for either paypal (preferred) or venmo is in the database.
4. Upon approval of first icon and once your payment link has been verified you will be added to the **Design Team**.

From then on repeat step #2 as often as you wish! Also many PRs can exsist and may be merged per request. As stated in the Offical [ReadMe](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/blob/master/README.md). We welcome several different variations. Keep all designs unique enough from each other and there will be no issue merging them.

> <u>**NOTE:**</u> The **Designer team** while not nessecarily a team is lead/liased by the **Design Team Leader**. This is a **Development Team member** role. This individual is in charge of  the **Designer team**. They will ensure everything with the Design team is running smooth.They are responsible for ensuring that all the [Design Templates](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/templates), [Design Guidlines](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/design) are up to date.

## ![Reviewers](https://api.iconify.design/mdi-clipboard-check.svg?color=%23ef5350&height=20) Reviewers

Anyone can review an icon submission! The difference is that only offical **Reviewers** can **Merge** an icon. Only the one who **Merges** the icon gets compensated via the donation system!

Every pull request has a reviewer checklist to follow. Offical **Reviewers** check things off. Anyone can comment on the issue with a copy of the completed checklist. Be sure to state that you approve the icon.

#### So How do you become an offical reviewer?

To join the **Reviewer team**, show a desire by reviewing submissions. An team member can then nominate you to the team after 5 successfuly submissions.

> <u>**NOTE:**</u> This is somewhat subjective, but ensure that 5 icons can are merged without any requested changes by a **Reviewer**. Its not an exact number just a guideline.

Votes will be cast for all Nominees, and if the majority is in favour the **Reviewer Team Leader** will add you to the team. If not your will recieve feedback on why and how to remedy an issues preventing your acceptance.

> <u>**NOTE:**</u> The number of reviewers is something that is related to the ammount of submissions. The **Reviewer team** will mandate how many team members are required at any given time.

> <u>**NOTE:**</u> The **Reviewer Team** is lead by the **Reviewer Team Leader**. This is a **Development Team member** role.  This individual is in charge of the **Reviewer Team**. They are maintain all the documentation, checklists, and guidlines. They also are the final approver for any and all nominations to the **Reviewer Team**.
