To request an icon simply create an [Icon Request](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ICON+Request&template=---icon-request.md&title=%5BICON+REQUEST%5D+) issue and follow the guidlines within the issue template. Also upvotes are most welcome!!! These help our designers find the most sought after designs.

Its very easy to become a **Designer**. All you need to do is

###### STEPS:
1. Familiarize yourself with our [Design Guidlines](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/design)
2. Create a pull request in response to an [Icon Request](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ICON+Request&template=---icon-request.md&title=%5BICON+REQUEST%5D+), ensuring to fill out the pull request template correctly
3. Prior to final approval for your first design a **Reviewer** will verify your payment link for either paypal (preferred) or venmo is in the database.
4. Upon approval of first icon and once your payment link has been verified you will be added to the **Design Team**.

From then on you just repeat step #2 as often as you wish! Also multiple PRs can exsist and may be merged per request. As stated in the Offical ReadMe. We welcome several different variations. As long as the designs are unique enough from each other there is nothing to preent them both or all if more from being merged.

> NOTE: The **Designer team** while not nessecarily a team is lead by or liased by the **Design Team Leader** which is a **Development Team** member role. This individual is in charge of the ensure everything with the **Design** team is running smoothly. They are responsible for ensuring that all the [Design Templates](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/templates), [Design Guidlines](https://github.com/forumicon/forumicons/tree/master/design) are properly updated as well as approving designers to the team along with the other **Development Team** members.

## ![Reviewers](https://api.iconify.design/mdi-clipboard-check.svg?color=%23ef5350&height=20) Reviewers

Firstly anyone can review an icon submission! The difference is that only offical **Reviewers** can **Merge** an icon. Furthermoreonly the one who **Merges** the icon gets compensated via the donation system!

Every pull request has a reviewer checklist to follow. Offical **Reviewers** can check things off, but anyone can respond to the issue with a copy of the checklist completed and a statment saying that they approve.

#### So How do you become an offical reviewer?

To be added to the reviewer team, show a desire by reviewing submissions. An Offical Reviewer will then nominate you for the team after 5 successfuly submissions.
> NOTE: This is somewhat subjective but ensure that 5 icons can be merged by an Offical Reviewer without any requested changes. Its not an exact number just a guideline.

Once Nominated the **Reviewer Team** will vote and if the majority is in favour the **Reviewer Team Leader** will add you to the **Reviewer** team. If not your will recieve feedback on why and how to remedy an issues preventing your acceptance.

> NOTE: The number of reviewers is something that is dictated by the ammount of submissions. With that being said, the **Reviewer** team will mandate how many team members are required at any given time.

> NOTE: The **Reviewer Team** is lead by the **Reviewer Team Leader** which is a **Development Team** member role. This individual is in charge of the **Reviewer Team**. They are responsible for mainting all the reviewer documentation, checklists, and guidlines as well as the final approver for any and all nominations to the **Reviewer Team**
