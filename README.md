Free to use community developed vector Forum icon/imgs ibrary

## WIP - Comming Soon

### What is **Forumicon**
fourmicon is a community built and maintained repository of completly free to use vector graphics to use for your forum/site/app/or project. There is no need to provide attribution. Instead we only ask that is you really like an asset or series that you click the donation link on to that icon/artists page on the wesite. Its completely not mandatory but helps to promote quality design submissions.

Furthermore you can acctually create an Icon/img request if you have a specific design that you need that is not available. The community will do its best to provide a quality design to meet your needs. Once approved and merged into the repository it will immediately be available via the iconify service which is covered later in more detail. We only ask again that to consider providing a donation for the work on the icon page. This is provided directly to the **Artist** `(85%)` | **Reviewer** `(10%)` | **FourmiCon** `(5%)`.

### How to use the icons?
Using the icons could not be simpiler. All of our icons are added to the [iconify](https://iconify.design/) icon service. Its a simple to use javascript api that fetches any requested icons and returns them to the page. See more on how this works at the following link.

### What is the process for getting custom icons?
1. Create an Icon Request issue.
2. Designer creates a Icon Pull Request
3. Reviewer approves Icon and merges Pull Request
4. Reviewer creates Iconify Pull Request
5. Reviewer once Iconify Pull Request is merged adds Iconify label to the Icon Pull Request
6. Check the fourmicon site for the name of your icon/s and follow the guide to adding to your project via Iconify.

### What is the benifit over all the other icon libraries?
There are alot of free icons/libraries out there to use.

##### Whats the difference between this and https://materialdesignicons.com/
###### Firstly nothing they are a great resource. However we have different types of icons (icons, emojis, imagesets, forum-icons, topic-icons, rank-imgs, etc...) which they do not. Secondly we offer the ability to request custom icons which they do not. Third we offer a donation based system for icon submissions. Lastly they have strict policy on duplication of usecases. Meaning that there are only allowed a few versions of each icon for example 

```css
home-solid
home-outline
home-variant-solid
home-variant-outline
```

###### We allow infinite variations on an icon. You can submit enitre sets of icons even. 

##### _Forumicon Nameing Conventions_:

```javascript
iconType-iconName-iconTheme-iconSetName
```

###### So For example you colud have: 

```css
home-color-spify
home-solid-spify
home-outline-spify
home-twotone-spify
imageset-home-solid-exl
imageset-home-outline-exl
emoji-house-color-twemoji
```

###### normal icon does not require an iconType

##### Each has a different license and attribution requirments. 
###### We have none!

##### Most are managed by singile individuals or small teams.
###### We enpower the entire community at large!

##### Most have verying degrees of design quality and loose practices or poor understanding of proper implimentation of vector graphics
###### We employ strict adherence and review processes to ensure the best qaulity and consistency as well as vast experience working with and on designing and integration icons into various applications & projects.

### Frequently Asked Questions?

##### What is Vector, What is Raster?
###### Vector graphics are a computer generated and render image. Meaning that its built via code. Raster images are compressed and pixelate or become blurry when you scale or zoom in on them.

##### Why Vector?
###### Vector graphics provide several benifits over "Raster Graphics".
- **They are scaleable to any size**
- **Completely responsive by nature**
- **Are fully uncompressed, pixel perfect - No pixelization or blurryness**
