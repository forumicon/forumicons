### Icon Size

All brand icons will be designed at 24px

All brand submissions must follow the guidelines for that brand. Unlike other categories of icons we are limited by the brands requirements. Not all brands work with all themes. Furthermore color themes of the brand must strictly adhere to the brand color guidelines.

We also require a seperate object property be added to the JSON file which will contain the color for the brand. `color: #29487d`

##### Note: All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by the author, nor vice versa.
