### 1.0

We follow the Google Material Design principles and as such find the 8px grid to be extremely versatile and idealy suited for working with web graphics, specificaly icons. You can find a setup guide for your application under the templates folder.

### 2.0

We have several different category types for the icons we support. Each of which can be seen below.

#### 2.1 Icon Types
