# Design Guidlines v.0.1.0

- All icons will be built to an 8px grid.
- Each `iconType` will have a size requirment For Exp: Standard monocrome icons will be built to 24px. This may be two smaller for more intricate and advanced icons. Check the Readme for each iocnType folder for specific guidlines for that type.
- All icons will be designed using one of the provided templates. NOTE: icon sets may be developed in a single file (using icon set templates)
- Sub icons for each set will be consistently sized and placed. We recomend 8px for the size but this is no a requirment.
- All spacing, gaps, offsets, outlines, etc will be no smaller than 2px to ensure proper rendring at small sizes.
